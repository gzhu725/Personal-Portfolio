          <h3>AICS - Registration Portal</h3>
          <p>made with:</p>
          <p>
            the acton institute of computer science (aics) is a nonprofit
            organization which provides free, accessible, computer science
            education to young students. i began working at aics as a python
            instructor and an operations member. as an operations member, the
            process of enrolling a student into a class was incredibly tedious.
          </p>
          <p>
            this is where the registration portal comes to play. several student
            developers and i created this registration portal to faciliate the
            registration process without having operation members do the tedious
            work the registration portal can handle. additionally, the portal
            handles gradework, such that aics instructors can input assignment
            names and grades in a data table on the site. feel free to take a
            look!

          the manga bookshelf web app was created for manga readers to track
          manga books they've read, would like to read, as well as interact with
          other users of the site. the website was public while it was hosted on
          digital ocean, but for now, if you want to see it running on your
          machine, you can follow the instructions in the readme.
