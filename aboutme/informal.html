    <h2>hello! i'm gloria :)</h2>
    <p>im a 21 year old still navigating life and having fun.</p>
    <p>
      i love exploring nyc, biking, "hiking" (aka walking ridiculous distances
      in nyc), taekwondo, singing, listening and recording music, and reading
      (trying to get into it).
    </p>
    <p>
      i take my music very seriously, and music means a lot to me. listen to my
      2024 spotify playlist below. there's a mix of everything on it.

      this summer i also tried to hike every borough in nyc. i unfortunately
      only got through 3 of the 5, but take a look at the routes taken and the
      scenery along the way!
