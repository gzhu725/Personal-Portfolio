      I am a senior at New York University studying computer science and
      economics. I am primarily interested in web development, frontend
      development, backend development, fullstack development, accessible
      computer science education, and "tech for fun".

      In the past, I have served as a computer science instructor for KTByte
      Computer Science Academy as well as the Acton Institute of Computer
      Science (AICS). KTByte uses the fun Processing library to teach students
      not only to code, but also show them what their code looks like in the
      form of games or simple animations. At KTByte, I have taught an assortment
      of lessons, ranging from group lessons, trial lessons for prospective
      students, and 1 on 1 lessons. At AICS, I taught a beginner Python class
      and handled operations such as class registration, and ensuring graders
      were grading assignments in a timely manner.
