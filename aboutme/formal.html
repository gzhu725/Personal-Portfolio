    <p>
      I am a senior at New York University studying computer science and
      economics. I am primarily interested in web development, fullstack
      development, accessible computer science education, and "tech for fun".
    </p>
    <p>
      In the past, I have served as a computer science instructor for KTByte
      Computer Science Academy as well as the Acton Institute of Computer
      Science (AICS). KTByte uses the fun Processing library to teach students
      not only to code, but also show them what their code looks like in the
      form of games or simple animations. At KTByte, I have taught an assortment
      of lessons, ranging from group lessons, trial lessons for prospective
      students, and 1 on 1 lessons. At AICS, I taught a beginner Python class
      and handled operations such as class registration, and ensuring graders
      were grading assignments in a timely manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first technical project/experience also came from AICS during the
      summer of 2023; several student developers and I created a registration
      portal that allows parents to seamlessly register their children for AICS
      classes. The portal also lifted the heavy work operations members used to
      do in order to enroll a student into classes. As a developer of the
      registration portal, my primary roles included creating different
      components for the site such as buttons, alerts, forms, and more with the
      help of MaterialUI (MUI), styling the entire website with CSS, as well as
      write backend endpoints to reflect any user input changes within our
      Firebase database. The project can be found on the
      <a href="/projects/">projects</a> section of this website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, I also was a software engineer intern for Casa Systems (now
      acquired by CommScope) in 2023. During my time at Casa Systems, I was
      tasked to write a tool in C that helps parse L2TP Wireshark files to
      detect packet loss within files. Previously, employees would have to spend
      days figuring out whether packet loss existed in these files and where the
      packet loss existed. With my tool, employees can run the script on a
      particular file to immediately detect packet loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2024, I was a software engineer for NYU's HSRN team, where I (re)worked
      on the NYU Corelink server's C# client. My responsibilities included
      redesigining the client to be more hierarchical (using inheritance). In
      addition to using thew new code structure, I had to ensure that the C#
      client can send and receive data to and from the Corelink server. Starting
      in the Fall of 2024, I will continue to work on the C# client.
    </p>

      In the summer of 2024, I was a Web Developer Intern for WSP. At WSP, I was
      tasked to redesign the UI of the Riser Diagram Generator, which is an
      add-in part of Revit. Using Bootstrap CSS, Typescript, and React.js, I was
      able to completely change the UI of the add in so that it is much easier
      for users to navigate. I also created tests for the UI using Cypress to
      make sure the application was running as expected. The internship was an
      incredibly interesting experience, as most of the people working there
      have a background in civil, structural, and/or mechanical engineering. It
      was interesting to see how software could be applied to an industry that
      isn't usually associated with software development.

      I am actively looking for a full time software developer role, so if you have an opportunity open, please feel free to contact me on my <a href="/contactme/">contact</a> page!
