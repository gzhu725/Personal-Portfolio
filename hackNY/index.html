      in NYC back when that wasn't rly a thing, as well as emphasizing using
      tech for social good. each year, a handleful of fellows are selected for a
      new hackNY class, where fellows will learn from different speakers in
      speaker series, participate in fun fellowship events, and talk with
      fellows, mentors, and the hackNY network.
